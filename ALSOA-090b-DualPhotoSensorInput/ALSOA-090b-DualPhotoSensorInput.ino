/*  <--- Dual photo sensor testing--->
 * 
 * This sketch shows the output of two photo sensors to 
 * the serial monitor. This is a step towards detecting the bearing
 * of a light source based on the information provided by the two sensors.
 * 
 * Components  used in this sketch
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - Breadboard
 *  - 2 x Light Dependent Resistors (Photoresistors) 
 *  - 2 x 10kÎ© resistors  
 *    
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------
 *  - None
 *
 * Connections 
 * -----------
 * Please see schematic 090b. The schematic is available as part of the 
 * lecture downloadable resources.
 * 
 * Other information
