/*  <--- Arduino Ultrasonic Distance sensor with micro Servo --->
 * 
 * This sketch causes a micro servo to
 * turn left, right and center.
 * 
 * Components  used in this sketch
 * ----------
 *  - Arduino Uno
 *  - Breadboard  
 *  - 1 x Micro generic Servo 
 *  - 1 x 100Î¼F capacitor 
 *    
 *  Libraries
 *  ---------
 *  - Servo.h
 *
 * Connections 
 * -----------
 *  - Connect the motor black wire to GND rail on the breadboard
 *  - Connect the motor red wire to 5V rail on the breadboard
 *  - Connect the motor white wire to digital pin 6
 *  
 *  For the breadboard:
 *  - Connect the GND rail of the breaboard to the GND pin of the Arduino
 *  - Connect the 5V rail of the breaboard to the 5V pin of the Arduino
 *  
 *  For the capacitors:
 *  - Plug the capacitor directly on the power rail of the breadboard. If you are
 *    using an electrolitic capacitor, beware of the polarity.
 * 
 * Other information
 * -----------------
 *  Always remember to plug in the Servo Motors batteries first and then the Arduino batteries.
